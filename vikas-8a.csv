1) it’s an eliminate. holds on the arete beyond what Carlos used exist higher up, and they significantly reduce the difficulty of the intro crux.

2) on a send burn, i ripped the critical dyno LH jug-crimp off. both sam and Carlos used that hold. the dyno is significantly harder now.

3) the line felt v9/10 until the break. It felt 8a to me now. more ascents post break will have to confirm.

4) it goes in a more fingery, static fashion. i don’t have the strength for it, but there is an alternative to the dyno.

5) all that said, this line presented a wonderful challenge in a beautiful setting. nice work Carlos!","null","0","null"

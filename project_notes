dont use topoJson files if you arent using the topoJson package --> use
geoGson. topoJson has some compression benefits.

https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/static-tiles/ api used by bostock zoomable map
tiles example (https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-map-tiles)

to get your ip:

ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1

you can use this with the port to access a server on your mobile device.

things i tried:

1. rendering maps directly using svgs/d3/geojson. this is a pain, especially with zoom. there are libraries that do this.
2. use mapbox to pull tiles using d3. then adding things on became a pain. i could do this using mapbox studio GUI, but i could not get it to work, and it was a clunky way to handle data.
3. i wanted to paint d3 svg on top of mapbox tiles, but you are only pulling images from mapbox tiles. how do i know where in an image to place a lat,long point? no way to know.
4. discovered mapbox js library that allows lat/long info. use that to draw map, but control all data from my end.

Trying to fetch data from census api, running into conflict between encodeURI and URLsearchparams. %20 vs + sign.
